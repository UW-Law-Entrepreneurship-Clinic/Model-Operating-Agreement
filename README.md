<p>
This document was created by students in the UW Law & Entrepreneurship Clinic</br>
<a href="https://www.uwle.org/">www.uwle.org</a></p>
<p>This document is for a Single-Member Manager-Managed LLC in the State of Wisconsin</p>
<h1>Filing Instructions</h1>
<p>The DFI’s website is very straightforward and goes through the step-by-step filing process for
forming an LLC. The following steps are required for the formation of an LLC:</br>
Before filing, please search the DFI database for names before choosing one.</br>
<ol>
<li>File the Articles of Organization on the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions’
website. <a href="https://www.wdfi.org/apps/CorpFormation/directions.aspx?type=12" target="_new">https://www.wdfi.org/apps/CorpFormation/directions.aspx?type=12</a></li>
<ol>
<li>Name of the Entity</li>
<li>b. Registered Agent: The name of the registered agent and the registered office address must be provided. This can be a personal address but remember that the information is public once filed with the DFI. The registered agent’s address cannot be a PO Box.</li>
<li>c. When asked what type of management (either Manager or Member), please chose Manager.</li>
<li>d. Organizer: The name and complete addresses of the organizer. An organizer participates in forming the company and is responsible for those costs unless/until the company indemnifies the Organizer via ratification of actions. In your case this could be either one of you.</li>
<li>e. Drafter: The name of the drafter of this document. The drafter is the person who is completing the articles of organization.</li>
<li>f. Signature: The articles must be signed by the organizers and can be signed electronically.</li>
<li>g. Contact: The name, address, email address, and phone number of the contact person for this filing. All communications regarding this filing will be via the e-mail address of the contact person.</li>
<li>h. Payment: A credit card will be required to file online (Visa or MasterCard). If paid online, the filing fee is $130.00.</li>
<li>i. There will not be a paper certificate once the LLC is filed with the DFI. The organizer will receive notice of “submitted but not filed,” then receive a notification that the company has been filed.</li>
</ol>
<li>2. Obtain a Federal Employer Identification Number (“EIN”).</li>
<ol>
<li>a. This can be obtained from the IRS website found at: https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online</li>
<li>b. The EIN for your business will only be used to open a bank account and for Employment Tax purposes if the LLC has an employee in the future.</li>
</ol></ol>
</p>
<h1>Operating Agreement</h1>
<p>Functionally, this document will appoint the single member as Manager, name a successor Manager, and track the capital contributions. This document cannot be used with multiple members and by its terms will terminate if a second member is added. It should also not be used if the LLC will be filing an S-Corp election.</p>
